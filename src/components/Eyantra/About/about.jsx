       The eYantra Club at NIT Andhra Pradesh is a vibrant group of students passionate about exploring and creating with drones, electric vehicles, and electronics. Located in Tadepalligudem, our club provides a space where members can get hands-on experience building and experimenting with the latest technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles and electric vehicle prototypes.

We focus on learning by doing—through workshops, seminars, and group projects—helping members gain practical skills and solve real-life problems. Our club encourages sharing knowledge, teamwork, and responsible engineering to support personal growth as creative problem solvers and innovators.

The eYantra Club is a place where passion for technology comes alive, inspiring students to push their limits and work toward a future of smarter, more sustainable mobility.

“Reaching for the sky with our ideas, we build the machines of tomorrow that fly and move the world.”
